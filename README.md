The Barangay Information System of Bagong Ilog is a web-based system developed to digitize and streamline barangay administrative processes. The system allows residents of Barangay Bagong Ilog to register online as official barangay citizens and request important documents through an online platform.

The system supports online requests for commonly issued certificates such as Barangay Indigency, Barangay Clearance, and Business Permit, reducing the need for manual paperwork and in-person transactions. This helps improve efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility of barangay services.

In addition to citizen services, the system provides record tracking and management functionalities for barangay administrators. These features allow administrators to securely manage resident records, monitor certificate requests, and maintain organized data for barangay operations. The project was developed for academic purposes and demonstrates the application of web-based information systems in local government services.
